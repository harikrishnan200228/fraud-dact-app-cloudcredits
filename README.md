# fraud-deact-app-cloudcredits
Develop a model to detect fraudulent transactions in financial data. Use classification algorithms and anomaly detection techniques to identify suspicious activities.
ust Built a Credit Card Fraud Detection App!

 🔍 Using real transaction data + machine learning + Streamlit!

Over the last few days, I worked on building a complete data analysis pipeline to detect fraudulent credit card transactions:

✅ Data preprocessing

 ✅ Feature scaling

 ✅ Logistic Regression model

 ✅ Streamlit web app for live predictions

 ✅ Saved + loaded the model using Joblib

🛠️ Tools Used: Python | Pandas | Scikit-learn | Streamlit | Joblib

🔐 This project helps demonstrate how machine learning can automate fraud detection and support real-time decision making in financial transactions.

🖥️ I’ve deployed it locally ON streamlit
